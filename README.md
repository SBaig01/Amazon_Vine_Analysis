## Summary 
There is a wide difference between the number of 5 star reviews that were paid (vine) vs. un-paid (non-vine). The results show that un-paid 5-star reviews were 52% vs. the paid reviews (0.18%). This shows that there is **negative** bias with paid reviews i.e. **no positive bias**.

To improve our results, we could compare the significance of the difference to determine if it was indeed significantly different based on the analysis populations.
